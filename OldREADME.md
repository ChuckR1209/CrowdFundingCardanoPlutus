### Marginalized Groups



The initial challenge with Web2-based crowdfunding is limited access, which results in reduced funding opportunities and exacerbates unequal distribution of resources. This excludes various groups from participating, including individuals from countries with sanctioned or authoritarian governments, marginalized communities such as sex workers, and regions without proper financial payment infrastructure.

The second issue is the imbalance of power and responsibility in Web2 crowdfunding. These platforms are operated by large, centralized companies, which gives them significant market power to charge excessive fees. Furthermore, their centralization makes them susceptible to government intervention or executive decisions that restrict access to potential funders.



Moreover, there is a subtler but potentially more significant issue - the majority of projects that use these platforms for crowdfunding are centralized organizations themselves. Funders are required to rely on their trustworthiness in fulfilling their commitments. There is a widespread reputation for Kickstarter projects to miss their delivery targets, and even reputable charitable organizations are not exempt from this.

### Ease of Use 

Web3 crowdfunding platforms are based on globally accessible cryptocurrency systems, eliminating the barriers and difficulties associated with Web2 platforms. This global and hassle-free nature has played a key role in the recent growth of Web3 crowdfunding, as seen in the success of Constitution DAO.

How do they operate? A typical Web3 crowdfunding platform, such as Juicebox and Mirror, accepts ETH from investors and returns a token as a proof of receipt. Tokens, which are made possible by the versatility of Web3, can serve various purposes. Some crowdfunding projects use their tokens as a simple representation of the investors' contributions, while others use it as a form of governance token. Regardless of the purpose, tokens are highly popular as people enjoy owning and possessing tokens, even if they don't necessarily confer any rights.
